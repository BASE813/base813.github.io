								<h3>Empathy</h3>
								<p>I feel sorry for the younger generation moving through education. They are expected to work toward careers that in all likelihood do not even exist at the moment, even unimaginable to us. We should be educating our younger generation on creative problem solving, critical thinking, and other tools (obviously as well as STEM etc), to prepare them to adapt, evolve, and move like water through the minefield of career choices when the time comes. We are all prone to the risks of change, without adapting and evolving our knowledge and skills, there are risks of becoming devalued in the demand and supply chain of talent in companies already evolving.</p>
								<hr/>
								<h3>The Future, impossible to predict</h3>
								<p>Humans find safety in group-think and familiarity. Unsurprisingly with current velocity of change, the more people start to cling to safety. <strong><b>This is not a negative statement, it's our nature, we are built like this.</b></strong> We are also the people that are enthused and enthralled by the opportunities to create, collaborate, and innovate and we are leading the charge in an exponential acceleration of change.</p>
								<p>Estonia’s e-Residency program is built on blockchain, UK lawyers are testing blockchain in the house buying process (3 months reduced to 1 week), even the Government have projects looking at how innovative new technologies can improve the house buying process, they are incredibly forward thinking in their digital push. Yes the Government is forward thinking.</p>								
								<hr/>
								<h3>What do I see</h3>
								<p>The history of SaaS is coming to an end, and other emerging technologies are pushing through, so where and what does the future hold.</p>
								<hr/>
								<h3>What sets you apart from competitors when you consider technology and data</h3>
								<ul>
											<li>Internally - employee skills for the future</li>
											<li>Customer experience</li>
											<li>Industry efficiency / competition</li>
											</ul>
								<hr />
								<h3>How we arrived at this moment:</h3>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/saas.jpeg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>We are experiencing exponentially accelerating change, starting with a move from legacy toward our pure SaaS state for the last 20 years, in reality the first major players (Netsuite and Salesforce) put in their flags c.15 years ago.</p>
								<hr />
								<h3>Salesforce.com release v1.0</h3>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/sfdc1.jpeg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<hr />
								<h3>Look around</h3>
								<p>Today, businesses and consumers access SaaS, even unaware that they do. If SaaS is described as software accessed through the browser whilst hosted/managed by an external party, then Snapchat, Google, Netflix, WhatsApp, BookFace, and many other people call ‘websites’, are SaaS products/applications. If you use this catchall, the term is historical and a signal of the start of an internet/online rebirth.</p>
								<hr/>
								<h3>SaaS = internet</h3>
								<p>The Internet as we used to call it, now “online”, is where you access content/function from the coding of HTML5 / CSS / Ruby On Rails / Node.js, all meshed in various guises providing services or solutions you went hunting.</p>
								<hr />
								<h3>Demands</h3>
								<p>With the increased use and awareness of technology and data, there are increased demands and expectations. There is misunderstanding and misinformation, it's sometimes seen as a solution rather than a supporting tool to enhance humans and inform critical thinking.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are 2 areas misunderstood, they are incredibly complex and require careful and knowledgeable design and use, you do not just switch it on.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>The use of data has become a badge of control and knowledge, data is not knowledge, it is not understanding.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Its very easy to jump to assumptions without some form of understanding on the flaws as well as strengths of data. Taken on face value, eating cheese increases your risk of dying from being tangled in your bed sheets - it must be true, the data says so. </p>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/cheese.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p></p>
								<p>We must be careful of our own biases and frameworks, challenging ourselves before we stand and present facts as knowledge. </p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Skills and understanding have not grown as fast as the technology and data revolution, and so we see explosions in job roles that look to support the growing demands in these areas, to support, inform, and to protect from the dangers of mis-allocation of capital and misinterpretations of data.</p>
								<hr />
								<h3>Concluding Ramblings</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>There is no shame in not knowing</li>
									<li>You are natural in the desire to want to remain safe</li>
									<li>You are not expected to keep up</li>
									<li>Support and help the young to think differently, to learn the tools to adapt</li>
									<li>Understand yourself</li>
									<li>You only have to ask the people that know, understand, that spend sleepless nights trying to keep up themselves</li>
									<li>“Take no thought of who is right or wrong or who is better than. Be not for or against”</li>
									</ul>
